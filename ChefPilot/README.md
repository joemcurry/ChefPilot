ChefPilot Flutter app scaffold (placeholder)

This directory was created to match the project's coding guidelines. It contains the minimal Flutter project structure and placeholder files:

- lib/
  - ApplicationOwner/*
  - Tenants/*
  - Shared/*
- ios/
- android/
- macos/
- web/
- pubspec.yaml

Next steps:
- If you already have a frontend in `client/`, consider moving or merging it into this `ChefPilot/` directory.
- Run `flutter pub get` inside this folder to fetch Flutter dependencies.
- Replace `lib/main.dart` with the real app entrypoint when ready.
